<summary>A PREREQ</summary>
<br>
1.A package refers to the enclosure or casing that houses a semiconductor chip. It provides physical protection, electrical connections, and heat dissipation for the chip.<br>
  
2.An integrated circuit (IC), is a small piece of semiconductor material, typically made of silicon. It contains electronic components such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors that are interconnected to perform specific functions <br>

3.A die refers to a small block of semiconducting material on which a specific functional circuit is fabricated. It is usually cut from a larger silicon wafer during the manufacturing process <br>

4.IP can refer to various things. It can represent proprietary designs, algorithms, or architectures that are protected by intellectual property rights. Semiconductor companies often develop their IP, which can include specialized circuit designs, software algorithms, or system architectures that give them a competitive advantage in the market
